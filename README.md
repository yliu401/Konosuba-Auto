# Konosuba Automata
Very simplistic program to automate repetitive gameplay in Konosuba: Fantastic Days.

Auto-repeat app for Konosuba: Fantastic Days, detect's the "Next", "Repeat", and "Ok" buttons then clicks the buttons in the corresponding order to repeat the same stage.

A lot of this code has been forked from https://github.com/Fate-Grand-Automata/FGA, without them this code would not exist and there still exists a lot of redudant code that does not apply to the app Konosuba: Fantastic Days but, for the game Fate Grand Order.

This is just a very simple/fun project I decided to work on and make the pre-forked program work for a different existing game.
Does not have much functionality other than re-running the same battle again as I found this process to be very annoying to do manually. As stated from before a lot of functionality is irrelavant as it only applies to Fate Grand Order.
I may or may not add more funcationality, depending on the users, but highly unlikely as I just made this for myself.

## How to Use?
1. Install from the link given above and launch the app.
2. Click on `Start Service` and give all the permissions it asks for.
3. Open Konosuba: Fantastic Days. Now, you can see a button with play icon on it floating on screen.
4. Run the battle you want to repeat
5. Once the battle is complete, press play and it will run forever until it runs out of stamina (May update this if people ask, but highly unlikely).
